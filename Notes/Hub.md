# Hub
##### Definition
A hub is a device which is used for for the connection of devices in a network. It connects several devices in a LAN and acts there as a central connection. 

##### Questions 
Hub works pretty stupid. When it receives a packet of data from one network device, it transmits the packet to all of the other network devices. so all data received through one port is sent to all other ports. A hub operates on the physical layer. 

##### Hubs vs switches
First of all, while a hub operates on the physical layer, a switch operates on the data link layer. But more important is that a switch is a intelligent device and packet filtering is available there.
