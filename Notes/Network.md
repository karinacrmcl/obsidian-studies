- `Title:` [[Network]]

First we need to find an adress of the site we are trying to open. 
You don't have a public ip adress for computer, but for the router.
Every router for each direction have an another port. Between router and computer the local network is created, and when the request is made to router, only public adress is available, while local ip adress is available only inside the network created.
